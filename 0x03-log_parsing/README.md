## Description:

This repository contains a Python script designed to parse log entries from standard input, 
compute specific metrics, and print statistics. The script processes logs line by line, following a predefined format, 
and outputs cumulative statistics every 10 lines or upon receiving a keyboard interruption (Ctrl + C).
