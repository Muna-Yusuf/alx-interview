# 0x01. Lockboxes 

## Description:

This project aims to teach you how to implement a Python function that determines if all the boxes in a given list can be unlocked. 
Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1, and each box may contain keys to other boxes. 
The goal is to check if you can unlock all the boxes starting from the first box (box 0), which is initially unlocked.
