## Description:
This script defines a function rotate_2d_matrix(matrix) that rotates an n×nn×n 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.
The rotation is performed in two steps: first, the matrix is transposed (rows are converted into columns), and then each row is reversed.
The provided test case demonstrates the function by rotating a 3x3 matrix.
